Version: 0.0.0.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Kenneth",
           family = "Osborne",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "ken.osborne.iii@gmail.com")
Description: Uses a pre-existing API to pull XML data from BoardGameGeek.com. Interprets the XML into a data frame, for easy data manipulation. Generates relevant player and game statists a la BG Stats App, but also provides more in depth stats that are perhaps more relevant to the hardcore gamer. Allows a user to interact with stats via a shiny app.
